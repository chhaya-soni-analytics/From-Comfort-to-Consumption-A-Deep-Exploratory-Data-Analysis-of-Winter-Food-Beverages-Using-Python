# From-Comfort-to-Consumption-A-Deep-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Winter-Food-Beverages-Using-Python

## 📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a winter food and beverages dataset to understand pricing patterns, customer ratings, and category-wise trends.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
- Dataset contains information about winter food and beverage items.
- Features include price, rating, category, calories, and popularity indicators.
- The dataset was provided in CSV format.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Spyder Notebook
- Numpy

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Handling missing values
- Univariate analysis (Price, Rating, Calories)
- Category-wise analysis
- Correlation analysis using heatmap
- Outlier detection using box plots

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Price distribution histogram
- Rating distribution
- Category-wise average price
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Correlation heatmap

## 💡 Key Insights
- Certain food categories are priced higher during winter.
- Higher-rated items tend to fall within a moderate price range.
- Outliers exist in pricing and calorie values, indicating premium or specialty items.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Perform customer segmentation
- Add seasonal comparison with summer data
